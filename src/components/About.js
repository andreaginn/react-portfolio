  <p>I have loved creating art since I was very young.<br />
    I primarily work with white charcoal on black paper, but have also experimented <br />
    with acrylic, watercolors, graphite drawings, and photography.<br />
    This site will be periodically updated with new coding projects which will replace the current placeholders.
